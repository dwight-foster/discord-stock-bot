# Stock Discord bot
This is a very simple discord bot that can show you recent prices and other things. You can implement it in any discord channel that will accept bots and use the commands to display different information. 
## Requirements
Alpha Vantage key: found [here](https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key)

finvizfinance api: https://pypi.org/project/finvizfinance/

You can use a different api or library you would just have to change the code.
